This folder contains the subfolders _raw_ and _clean_. In the _raw_ subfolder the .csv files are the separate datasets that were obtained from two sources, 
while the _clean_ folder holds only the merged and cleaned dataset with six final variables in .csv format.
For more info about the sources and the final variables please see the variables.xlsx file in this folder.
